# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?  
***Pretty confident. Certainly need practice!***
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?  
***Also pretty confident, but as these get more complex, I definitely slow down!***
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?  
***Good, I like if statements. Tricky to figure out the best logical order sometimes...***
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?  
***About an hour. It lined up well with my expected time.***
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  
***Keyboard shortcuts and getting bogged down with syntax definitely could use work. I will do a little each day on these to keep gaining skills.***
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?  
***I can't get autosuggestions to go away in vsCode. Gonna head to Slack for that!***
